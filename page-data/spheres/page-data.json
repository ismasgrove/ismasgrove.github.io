You will notice that the little spheres will gladly go through the side walls, but not the bottom plane. It's because the latter is stealthily thicker in the Cannon physics world. It'd be harder to get away with when it comes to the side walls though.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"spheres","sceneCode":"SPHERES"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/spheres/"}},
