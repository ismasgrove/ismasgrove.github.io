React is awesome, and I'm a huge fan of the paradigm it introduces. using it and learning more about it has definitely improved my coding experience. finally I can find a sense of comfortable structure within the webstack mumbo jumbo with a seemingly infinite improvement potential only crippled by how much I know.</p>\n<p>there's also tailwind. one of the reasons why I was complaining about 'difficulty of maintaining' was I felt my scss file was getting too large. I fully realize it isn't large by the standards of well-accustomed, dedicated and seasoned web developers. that's according to my experience with other languages. it pairs nicely with react in terms of how I can separate my components so I could know exactly know where and what to look for, when I want to make changes.</p>\n<p>an unplanned but very welcome change was also the adoption of react-three. learning threejs was what pivoted me into web apps from the start. I must say, three is very pleasant to use in this form.</p>\n<p>this is still in early stages.</p>\n<h3>TODO</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><del>complete jamstack by integrating markdown for easier articles</del></li>\n<li>improve container ui, <del>use typography for better formatting</del></li>\n<li>figure out how the page should look on mobile</li>\n<li>for the love of god, start working on actual scenes instead of getting distracted by code architecture and ui design</li>\n<li>improve code quality by utilizing styled components and others for more minimal jsx</li>\n<li>figure out how to structure background scenes for easy and smooth transitions</li>\n<li>add a 404 page</li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"title":"the beginning"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/posts/the-beginning/"}},
