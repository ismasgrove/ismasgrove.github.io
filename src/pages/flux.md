I was playing with planes when I made this. Literally filled the screen with planes, did random things with them and just let them guide me. This scene is a group of plane stacks rotating around an axis with a colored light source and some postprocessing.

Little do you know, you play with a primitive randomly and something relatively aesthetically pleasing can come up. Serves to show how powerful primitives are.
