title: 'what is this?'

I was told that it's impotrant for an aspiring visuals-centric developer to have a portfolio, though in my case, having dealt mostly with desktop and console based applications, I didn't feel as I had anything flashy to present. At the same time, I realized I was particularly lacking when it comes to the web, and decided it would be harmful to stay in my comfort zone forever. A modern day developer, even if focused on other things, should never fall below a certain threshold of basic web development fundamentals. It was my fondness of the Internet that got me into programming in the first place, so to let this remain the case, to me, was unacceptable.

The end result of both these concerns is this website. It's a portfolio that presents itself through the use of backgrounds and interactions. To make this happen, it's not a stretch to say I started learning the web from scratch. My Computer Engineering degree only walked me through the very basics of HTMl, CSS, PHP and relational databases, and needless to say, there was only a universe left to explore.

If a traditional portfolio is like a person's trophies on their wall, I'd like to think of mine as my vacation home. To see my other projects, you're welcome to browse through my [GitHub](https://github.com/ismasgrove) account.
