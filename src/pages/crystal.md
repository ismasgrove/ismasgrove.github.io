This one is only here because it was the very first one. I did something quick just to try out r3f. It was the only scene here for a while before I started gaining momentum.

If there's something funny about this, it's how I used the same object in my [Raytracing](https://github.com/ismasgrove/raytracing) project, using the same constructive technique I used there (two pyramids on top of each other) without realizing that an Octahedron geometry exists in THREE.
