A home scene should be simple and not overwhelming, so I settled for a sign generated using [this 512x512 image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ismasgrove/ismasgrove.github.io/source/static/home_sdf.png) as a Signed Distance Field texture and some shading, which is a technique [commonly used](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1b5hIMqz_wM) to render text on top of 3D in a way that scales well with high resolutions. You can toy with its parameters using [leva's](https://github.com/pmndrs/leva) controller.
