# isma's grove

I'm not sure if I should call this my portfolio or personal website at this point since it's still very much barren. It's not made to be a perfect frontend demo as much as it's me following my whims in a particularly experimental, futuristic aesthetic aspiring, self-indulgant direction (though some polish is still needed to reach that point). A basement full of experiments rather than a triumphant museum of acclaimed works.

Utilizing [@react-three](https://github.com/pmndrs/react-three-fiber) and GatsbyJS, this project is pretty much an ongoing learning endeavor, and as learning endevours never come to an end, I doubt I will ever stop adding content to it. Hopefully one day I'll end up with a very peculiar, content-filled website others can point out to from within the crowded web as something that's at least fun and interesting to look at.
